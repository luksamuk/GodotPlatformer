This project does everything described  in the three free videos, plus
adds some  configuration for  touch input, and  enables the  player to
jump higher when the jump button is held after stomping an enemy.

The videos can be found here:

above), and the code is also almost  identical to the one shown in the
free tutorial, the code here is provided under the MIT License.
